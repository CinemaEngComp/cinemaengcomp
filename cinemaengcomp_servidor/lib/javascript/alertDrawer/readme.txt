== Ubermondo Toys

You have just downloaded some code that we made to help ourselves get out of a sticky
situation, fix a bug, or avoid actual work.  It did the trick for us -- here's hoping it helps
you, too.

Just like everything we do, the software is Copyright (c) 2006 Dieter and Jennifer Randolph
(http://ubermondo.com), and released under the MIT license
(http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,

WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING 
FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR 
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

== Installation

Just link the file into the head of your HTML document, and you should be ready to rock.
Something like this should do the trick:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="yacketysmackety.js"></script>
	
If you need any help, drop us a line at http://ubermondo.com, and we'll see what we can do.

Even if you're NOT having any problems, stop by and let us know how you're using the code.
We'd love to hear from you.
